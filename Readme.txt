My independent project will be a type photo journal.

I plan on having a large picture on the left and a panel of information on the right. 

Quinn suggested that I use an API. I plan on using imgur's API for photo integration. I'm hoping that this API will help me with uploading/storing/serving up the images.

I have not decided on the way that the viewer will display seperate pairs of panels, but I believe I can dig something up in the imgur API.
